            <p>On discovering the dying plantwall, Danielle Wilde,
                UID Professor in Design for Sustainability, seized
                the opportunity to foster new collaborations across
                UmU, SLU and beyond. The original idea was to
                explore the vertical garden as a site for fostering
                human-plant interactions in the Arctic region, with
                a focus on the Boreal Forest. The idea evolved organically,
                influenced by collaborators, supporters,
                and the unbounded creativity of the students, working
                in and across disciplinary teams.

                M Rosario García Gil, Lecturer, Dept. of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology; Vice Dean, internationalisation,
                Faculty of Forest Sciences.
                García Gil led development and installation of the
                plant wall demonstrators for the Växtvägg project.
                García Gil's research is focused on forest genetics
                and the physiology of Boreal forests, where
                her main contribution has been to decipher the
                genetics of forests' adaptation to the local conditions
                and to integrate remote sensing into assisted
                adaptation models. Her determination to
                bring boreal forests closer to cities led to her and
                her company's participation in the project.

                vertically local flora and fauna in the cities, indoors
                and outdoors, inspired by García Gil's research
                into boreal forests and fascination for green urban
