                This exhibition is part of a research project to bring the boreal forest indoors to
                expand research, education and sensory engagement with this unique climate ecosystem. The work is a collaboration between Umeå Institute of Design (UID), UmU
                Department of Molecular Biology and SLU Faculty of Forest Sciences and Vertisà
                AB Umeå, with active engagement from the UID student climate group. Inspired
                by the death of the existing UmArts plantwall, we came together during the fall of
                2022 to follow its decay; then from January to May 2023, we experimented with
                the molecular biosystems active in the seemingly dead wall; bringing the complex
                ecosystem of the Boreal Forest indoors; and developing aesthetic, educational
                and research opportunities for indoor vertical gardens in the Arctic region.

                Project outcomes will inform research into local and extended growing seasons;
                boreal forest and human connections with the plants, critters, forage-able foods
                and soil of this unique forest microbiome; and propose diverse possibilities for
                the design and implementation of vertical gardens in the Arctic
