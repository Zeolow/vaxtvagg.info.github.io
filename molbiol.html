            <p>As the phoenix rises from the ashes, so the vertical garden at the UmArts Campus. In this mythic journey of death and rebirth, Hanna Forsberg and Rana Zeeb have taken to the field, with support from Javier Avila Cariño and Teresa Frisan. They begin at the UmU department of Molecular Biology, collect lab supplies, then head to the Arts Campus with the intention of studying the evolving microbial diversity of the dying, soon to be reborn, vertical garden.</p>

                * This project is the bachelor thesis work of Hanna
                Forsberg and Rana Zeeb.
                Hanna Forsberg and Rana Zeeb develop most of
                the experimental set-up and carry on all the experimental
                work. Teresa Frisan and Javier Avilla
                Cariño perform mentoring support. The project is
                financed is Department of Molecular Biology.

                At the Arts Campus, they sample the air, soil and
                leaves before the dying wall is removed. The intention
                is to characterise the microbiome of the
                dying ecosystem and surviving plants, then to later
                sample the reborn ecosystem. They sample:
                <br><br>
                / Soil pockets with living plants <br>
                / Soil pockets with dead plants<br>
                / Leaves of living plants<br>
                / Static water, in the drains<br>
                <br>
                All sample locations are labelled with tape and a
                flag. Other student teams then harvest the still-living
                plants for rehabilitation and later replanting.

                (after removal)
                <br><br>
                The vertical garden is then removed, and Hanna
                Forsberg and Rana Zeeb take air samples.

                <br><br>
                In the lab, the samples are plated in different types of bacterial growth medium; the number of microbes are counted; each unique bacteria and fungus colony is characterised based on its morphology, capacity to grow in particular media, and motility capacity.

                / Compare microbial composition between sectors with dead and living plants
                <br>
                / Compare microbial composition of each sector hosting different types of still-living plants
                <br>
                / Compare the amount and type of microorganisms dispersed in the air before and just after the removal of the dying vertical garden
                <br><br>
                (preliminary analysis)
                <br><br>
                The soil without plants has a higher microbial
diversity than the soil with plants. This finding
suggests that plants require a specific microbial
ecosystem and possibly contribute to its determination.
                <br><br>
                Potential pathogenic bacteria has been found in
the soil and air close to the vertical garden. The
team is now mapping whether the presence of the
plants restrict growth of these bacteria.
                <br><br>
                Samples collected from the water in close proximity
to the vertical garden present a microbial
pattern closely related to the air samples, rather
than to the soil samples, suggesting cross-contamination
between these environments.
                <br><br>
                As the new wall takes shape, Hanna Forsberg and
Rana Zeeb will continue their quest, studying the
microbial evolution of the new wall, which is being
birthed from the ashes of the old one.

                / Understand whether there is a correlation between
plant survival and microbial microenvironment,
which may be used to develop a soil with
the microbial composition to support sustainable
vertical gardens. <br>
                / Assess the presence of potentially beneficial or
pathogenic microorganisms in the air in proximity
of a vertical garden, with the aim of promoting
microbiologically safe urban cultivation
approaches.<br>
