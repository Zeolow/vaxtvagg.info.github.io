                (what)
                <br/><br/>
                The panels that cover and connect the different irrigation modules were created for växtvägg as part of Caja Peters' semester project, as an extension of her work with the UID Climate Group. They are grown from mycelium, a material that consists of fungi and organic waste. The focus of this work is to experiment with the material, find its extremes by connecting forest and fungi and to elaborate a long-term observation.
                <br/><br/>
                Instead of baking and curing the material—the traditional method for stopping mycelium growth— the mushrooms in Växtvägg are kept alive. The vision is to create a vertical forest that functions symbiotically, where plants and mushrooms form a unit that communicates, exchanges water and nutrients, and benefits from each other. The mycelium will ultimately grow to be a part of the wall.
                <br/><br/>
                Caja developed three design concepts to evaluate the effects of different forms and proximities on plant and mycelium growth. The microbiomes will be measured as they grow, to identify design attributes that are beneficial to both species, thus integrating molecular biologyinto the design process.
                <br/><br/>
                (why)
                <br/><br/>
                The aim is to develop a structure that will support the development of an indoor Boreal Forest; to study growth and development; and share emerging knowledge to educate others about the forest's uniqueness and global significance for our common shared future.
                <br/><br/>
                The living support structure serves as one more approach to bringing the outside ecosystem into an indoor environment to bring people and plants together for mutual growth.

                (design proposal 01)
                <br/><br/>
                The first design was inspired by the Boreal Forest landscape, where large stones are smoothed by ice in the Winter and, in the Spring, are covered in moss. A pattern is created by two repeating shapes that objects touch each other on the wall; the living mushroom can connect and grow these shapes into one symbiotic unit. If the fungi and plants degrade the base material, they can be easily swapped out, either fully or partially.

                The second shape connects the trays of the Vertisà module vertically, to align with the facade of the UmArts Campus. The plants in this proposal have more space to grow out of the panels, and may be less likely to connect with the fungi because of this.

                To explore possible shapes for the Växtvägg cover up, the UID Climate Group held a workshop with students from UID and Umeå School of Architecture (UMA). The result was a variety of concepts and the implementation of a large panel which covers a third of one module. The panel connect the most plants in one unit, offers a lot of space for the plants to grow thorough and represents the intertwined structure of the mycelium itself.
