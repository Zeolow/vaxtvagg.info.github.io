                Indoor vertical gardens, also known as living walls or green walls, improve air quality, temperature and humidity, as the plants filter the air by absorbing harmful pollutants and releasing oxygen. Vertical gardens can be aesthetically pleasing and are a space-efficient way to enjoy the beauty of plants and create vibrant, green spaces in the form of living artworks. They can recreate natural spaces, promote relaxation, productivity and creativity, and reduce stress through sensorial interaction, thus increasing human well-being. Indoor gardens also offer educational value, serving as living interactive tools for learning about plant species, biodiversity, ecosystems, sustainability, and the importance of environmental conservation.</p>
                <br/><br/>
                M Rosario García Gil, of SLU and Vertisà, has worked with SLU and UID students to develop two of the vertical gardens on display.

                (rockwool panels)
                <br/><br/>
                The first system is based on an inert substrate – rockwool panels, which are light and easy to ins- tall and support many different plant species. On these panels, three kinds of plants are grown: 
                <br/>
                / A diverse combination of ornamental species is growing and thriving and conquering the vertical space, to create an inspiring indoor landscape.
                <br/>
                / Different varieties of strawberries have been planted as an example of indoor food production.
                <br/>
                / 70 plants (Epipremnum spp) that were rescued from the previous plant wall have been transplanted into pots, fertilised and irrigated, then planted back on rockwool panels at their original locations. These plants stand as a testa- ment to plant resilience – they survived a pump malfunction, restricted (and in some cases no) water for many months, and conditions under which most of the other plants on the wall died.

                The second system is modular and made of [so- mething]. This system is based on soil cultivation, which allows us to reconstruct a natural boreal ecosystem. For these modules the student team at Skinnskatteberg cultivated Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Birch (Betula spp) seedlings. These will grow through panles out of mycelium, a material that consists of fungi and organic waste, which is one more element in our intention to bring the outside eco- system – in this case, the Boreal Forest – into an indoor environment.

                The third system consists of a shelf system that is designed to irrigate plants in pots. Developed by Växtbyggarna, the system is ideal for food cultiva- tion, which can be difficult to grow indoors because edibles and aromatics are particularly sensitive to pest infestations and pathogens. The plants in this design have ready access to water, and do not share soil, so their roots tend not to become entangled. They thus can be easily swapped out if they become infested, or require additional re- habilitation and care.
